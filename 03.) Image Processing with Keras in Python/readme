Images as data: visualizations
To display image data, you will rely on Python's Matplotlib library, and specifically use matplotlib's pyplot sub-module, that contains many plotting commands. Some of these commands allow you to display the content of images stored in arrays.

Instructions
100 XP
Import the image from the file bricks.png into data.
Display the image in data on the screen.

# Import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the image
data = plt.imread('bricks.png')

# Display the image
plt.imshow(data)
plt.show()


Images as data: changing images
To modify an image, you can modify the existing numbers in the array. In a color image, you can change the values in one of the color channels without affecting the other colors, by indexing on the last dimension of the array.

The image you imported in the previous exercise is available in data.

Instructions
100 XP
Modify the bricks image to replace the top left corner of the image (10 by 10 pixels) into a red square.
Visualize the resulting image.

# Set the red channel in this part of the image to 1
data[:10,:10,0] = 1

# Set the green channel in this part of the image to 0
data[:10,:10,1] = 0

# Set the blue channel in this part of the image to 0
data[:10,:10,2] = 0

# Visualize the result
plt.imshow(data)
plt.show()

Using one-hot encoding to represent images
Neural networks expect the labels of classes in a dataset to be organized in a one-hot encoded manner: each row in the array contains zeros in all columns, except the column corresponding to a unique label, which is set to 1.

The fashion dataset contains three categories:

Shirts
Dresses
Shoes
In this exercise, you will create a one-hot encoding of a small sample of these labels.

Instructions
100 XP
Initialize the ohe_labels variable to hold the one-hot encoded array.
Use np.where() to find the location of the category of the item in each iteration in categories.
Assign a 1 into the correct row/column combination in every iteration.

# The number of image categories
n_categories = 3
# The unique values of categories in the data
categories = np.array(['shirt', 'dress', 'shoe'])

# Initalize ohe_labels as all zeros
ohe_labels = np.zeros((len(labels), n_categories))

# Loop over the labels
for ii in range(len(labels)):
    # Find the location of this label in the categories variables
    jj = np.where(categories == labels[ii])
    # Set the corresponding zero to one
    ohe_labels[ii, jj] = 1
    
    
Evaluating a classifier
To evaluate a classifier, we need to test it on images that were not used during training. This is called "cross-validation": a prediction of the class (e.g., t-shirt, dress or shoe) is made from each of the test images, and these predictions are compared with the true labels of these images.

The results of cross-validation are provided as one-hot encoded arrays: test_labels and predictions.

Instructions
100 XP
Multiply the arrays with each other and sum the result to find the total number of correct predictions.
Divide the number of correct answers (the sum) by the length of predictions array to calculate the proportion of correct predictions.


# Calculate the number of correct predictions
number_correct = (test_labels * predictions).sum()
print(number_correct)

# Calculate the proportion of correct predictions
proportion_correct = number_correct / predictions.shape[0]
print(proportion_correct)


Build a neural network
We will use the Keras library to create neural networks and to train these neural networks to classify images. These models will all be of the Sequential type, meaning that the outputs of one layer are provided as inputs only to the next layer.

In this exercise, you will create a neural network with Dense layers, meaning that each unit in each layer is connected to all of the units in the previous layer. For example, each unit in the first layer is connected to all of the pixels in the input images. The Dense layer object receives as arguments the number of units in that layer, and the activation function for the units. For the first layer in the network, it also receives an input_shape keyword argument.

This course touches on a lot of concepts you may have forgotten, so if you ever need a quick refresher, download the Keras Cheat Sheet and keep it handy!

Instructions
100 XP
The first layer receives images as input, has 10 units and 'relu' activation.
The second input layer has 10 units and 'relu' activation.
The output layer has one unit for each category (3 categories) and 'softmax' activation.

# Imports components from Keras
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

# Initializes a sequential model
model = Sequential()

# First layer
model.add(Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)))

# Second layer
model.add(Dense(10, activation='relu'))

# Output layer
model.add(Dense(3, activation='softmax'))


Compile a neural network
Once you have constructed a model in Keras, the model needs to be compiled before you can fit it to data. This means that you need to specify the optimizer that will be used to fit the model and the loss function that will be used in optimization. Optionally, you can also specify a list of metrics that the model will keep track of. For example, if you want to know the classification accuracy, you will provide the list ['accuracy'] to the metrics keyword argument.

Instructions
100 XP
Write code to compile the model with the 'adam' optimizer and 'categorical_crossentropy' as the loss function.

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', 
           loss='categorical_crossentropy', 
           metrics=['accuracy'])
           
 
 
 Fitting a neural network model to clothing data
In this exercise, you will fit the fully connected neural network that you constructed in the previous exercise to image data. The training data is provided as two variables: train_data that contains the pixel data for 50 images of the three clothing classes and train_labels, which contains one-hot encoded representations of the labels for each one of these 50 images. Transform the data into the network's expected input and then fit the model on training data and training labels.

The model you compiled in the previous exercise, and train_data and train_labels are available in your workspace.

Instructions
100 XP
Prepare the data for fitting by reshaping it.
Fit the model by passing the input training data and training labels to the model's .fit() method.

train_data = train_data.reshape((50, 784))

# Fit the model
model.fit(train_data, train_labels, validation_split=0.2, epochs=3, verbose=False);

Cross-validation for neural network evaluation
To evaluate the model, we use a separate test data-set. As in the train data, the images in the test data also need to be reshaped before they can be provided to the fully-connected network because the network expects one column per pixel in the input.

The model you fit in the previous exercise, and test_data and test_labels are available in your workspace.

Instructions
100 XP
Reshape the test_data so that it can be used to evaluate the model.
Evaluate the model on test_data using test_labels.


test_data = test_data.reshape((10, 784))

# Evaluate the model
model.evaluate(test_data, test_labels)


One dimensional convolutions
A convolution of an one-dimensional array with a kernel comprises of taking the kernel, sliding it along the array, multiplying it with the items in the array that overlap with the kernel in that location and summing this product.

Instructions
100 XP
Multiply each window in the input array with the kernel and sum the multiplied result and allocate the result into the correct entry in the output array (conv).

array = np.array([1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0])
kernel = np.array([1, -1, 0])
conv = np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])

# Output array
for ii in range(8):
    conv[ii] = (kernel * array[ii:ii+3]).sum()

# Print conv
print(conv)

Image convolutions
The convolution of an image with a kernel summarizes a part of the image as the sum of the multiplication of that part of the image with the kernel. In this exercise, you will write the code that executes a convolution of an image with a kernel using Numpy. Given a black and white image that is stored in the variable im, write the operations inside the loop that would execute the convolution with the provided kernel.

Instructions
100 XP
Select the right window from the image in each iteration and multiply this part of the image with the kernel.
Sum the result and allocate the sum to the correct entry in the output array (results).
Defining image convolution kernels
In the previous exercise, you wrote code that performs a convolution given an image and a kernel. This code is now stored in a function called convolution() that takes two inputs: image and kernel and produces the convolved image. In this exercise, you will be asked to define the kernel that finds a particular feature in the image.

For example, the following kernel finds a vertical line in images:

np.array([[-1, 1, -1], 
          [-1, 1, -1], 
          [-1, 1, -1]])

kernel = np.array([[-1, -1, -1],
                   [1, 1, 1],
                   [-1, -1, -1]])
                   
 Define a kernel that finds a light spot surrounded by dark pixels.


kernel = np.array([[-1, -1, -1], 
                   [-1, 1, -1],
                   [-1, -1, -1]])
                   
                   
  
 Define a kernel that finds a dark spot surrounded by bright pixels.




kernel = np.array([[1, 1, 1], 
                   [1, -1, 1],
                   [1, 1, 1]])
                   
                   
                   
Convolutional network for image classification
Convolutional networks for classification are constructed from a sequence of convolutional layers (for image processing) and fully connected (Dense) layers (for readout). In this exercise, you will construct a small convolutional network for classification of the data from the fashion dataset.

Instructions
100 XP
Add a Conv2D layer to construct the input layer of the network. Use a kernel size of 3 by 3. You can use the img_rows and img_cols objects available in your workspace to define the input_shape of this layer.
Add a Flatten layer to translate between the image processing and classification part of your network.
Add a Dense layer to classify the 3 different categories of clothing in the dataset.

# Import the necessary components from Keras
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, Conv2D, Flatten

# Initialize the model object
model = Sequential()

# Add a convolutional layer
model.add(Conv2D(10, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', input_shape=(img_rows, img_cols, 1)))

# Flatten the output of the convolutional layer
model.add(Flatten())
# Add an outputlayer for the 3 categories
model.add(Dense(3, activation='softmax'))


Training a CNN to classify clothing types
Before training a neural network it needs to be compiled with the right cost function, using the right optimizer. During compilation, you can also define metrics that the network calculates and reports in every epoch. Model fitting requires a training data set, together with the training labels to the network.

The Conv2D model you built in the previous exercise is available in your workspace.

Instructions
100 XP
Compile the network using the 'adam' optimizer and the 'categorical_crossentropy' cost function. In the metrics list define that the network to report 'accuracy'.
Fit the network on train_data and train_labels. Train for 3 epochs with a batch size of 10 images. In training, set aside 20% of the data as a validation set, using the validation_split keyword argument.
# Compile the model 
model.compile(optimizer='adam', 
              loss='categorical_crossentropy', 
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Fit the model on a training set
model.fit(train_data, train_labels, 
          validation_split=0.20, 
          epochs=3, batch_size=10)
          
          
          
 Evaluating a CNN with test data
To evaluate a trained neural network, you should provide a separate testing data set of labeled images. The model you fit in the previous exercise is available in your workspace.

Instructions
100 XP
Evaluate the data on a separate test set: test_data and test_labels.
Use the same batch size that was used for fitting (10 images per batch).

# Evaluate the model on separate test data
model.evaluate(test_data, test_labels, batch_size=10);


Add padding to a CNN
Padding allows a convolutional layer to retain the resolution of the input into this layer. This is done by adding zeros around the edges of the input image, so that the convolution kernel can overlap with the pixels on the edge of the image.

Instructions
100 XP
Add a Conv2D layer and choose a padding such that the output has the same size as the input.


# Initialize the model
model = Sequential()

# Add the convolutional layer
model.add(Conv2D(10, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', 
                 input_shape=(img_rows, img_cols, 1), 
                 padding='same'))

# Feed into output layer
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(3, activation='softmax'))


Add strides to a convolutional network
The size of the strides of the convolution kernel determines whether the kernel will skip over some of the pixels as it slides along the image. This affects the size of the output because when strides are larger than one, the kernel will be centered on only some of the pixels.

Instructions
100 XP
Construct a neural network with a Conv2D layer with strided convolutions that skips every other pixel.

# Initialize the model
model = Sequential()

# Add the convolutional layer
model.add(Conv2D(10, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', 
              input_shape=(img_rows, img_cols, 1), 
              strides=2))

# Feed into output layer
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(3, activation='softmax'))


Calculate the size of convolutional layer output
Zero padding and strides affect the size of the output of a convolution.

What is the size of the output for an input of size 256 by 256, with a kernel of size 4 by 4, padding of 1 and strides of 2?

Creating a deep learning network
A deep convolutional neural network is a network that has more than one layer. Each layer in a deep network receives its input from the preceding layer, with the very first layer receiving its input from the images used as training or test data.

Here, you will create a network that has two convolutional layers.

Instructions
100 XP
The first convolutional layer is the input layer of the network. This should have 15 units with kernels of 2 by 2 pixels. It should have a 'relu' activation function. It can use the variables img_rows and img_cols to define its input_shape.
The second convolutional layer receives its inputs from t

from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, Conv2D, Flatten

model = Sequential()

# Add a convolutional layer (15 units)
model.add(Conv2D(15, kernel_size=2, activation='relu', 
              input_shape=(img_rows, img_cols, 1) 
              ))


# Add another convolutional layer (5 units)
model.add(Conv2D(5, kernel_size=2, activation='relu', 
              input_shape=(img_rows, img_cols, 1) 
              ))

# Flatten and feed to output layer
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(3, activation='softmax'))


Train a deep CNN to classify clothing images
Training a deep learning model is very similar to training a single layer network. Once the model is constructed (as you have done in the previous exercise), the model needs to be compiled with the right set of parameters. Then, the model is fit by providing it with training data, as well as training labels. After training is done, the model can be evaluated on test data.

The model you built in the previous exercise is available in your workspace.

Instructions
100 XP
Compile the model to use the categorical cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer.
Train the network with train_data for 3 epochs with batches of 10 images each.
Use randomly selected 20% of the training data as validation data during training.
Evaluate the model with test_data, use a batch size of 10.

# Compile model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', 
              loss='categorical_crossentropy', 
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Fit the model to training data 
model.fit(train_data, train_labels, 
          validation_split=0.2, 
          epochs=3, batch_size=10)

# Evaluate the model on test data
model.evaluate(test_data, test_labels, batch_size=10)

What is special about a deep network?
Networks with more convolution layers are called "deep" networks, and they may have more power to fit complex data, because of their ability to create hierarchical representations of the data that they fit.

What is a major difference between a deep CNN and a CNN with only one convolutional layer?

A deep network requires more data and more computation to fit.


How many parameters in a CNN?
We need to know how many parameters a CNN has, so we can adjust the model architecture, to reduce this number or shift parameters from one part of the network to another. How many parameters would a network have if its inputs are images with 28-by-28 pixels, there is one convolutional layer with 10 units kernels of 3-by-3 pixels, using zero padding (input has the same size as the output), and one densely connected layer with 2 units?

How many parameters in a deep CNN?
In this exercise, you will use Keras to calculate the total number of parameters along with the number of parameters in each layer of the network.

We have already provided code that builds a deep CNN for you.

Instructions
100 XP
Summarize the network, providing a count of the number of parameters.


Write your own pooling operation
As we have seen before, CNNs can have a lot of parameters. Pooling layers are often added between the convolutional layers of a neural network to summarize their outputs in a condensed manner, and reduce the number of parameters in the next layer in the network. This can help us if we want to train the network more rapidly, or if we don't have enough data to learn a very large number of parameters.

A pooling layer can be described as a particular kind of convolution. For every window in the input it finds the maximal pixel value and passes only this pixel through. In this exercise, you will write your own max pooling operation, based on the code that you previously used to write a two-dimensional convolution operation.

Instructions
100 XP
Index into the input array (im) and select the right window.
Find the maximum in this window.
Allocate this into the right entry in the output array (result).

# Result placeholder
result = np.zeros((im.shape[0]//2, im.shape[1]//2))

# Pooling operation
for ii in range(result.shape[0]):
    for jj in range(result.shape[1]):
        result[ii, jj] = np.max(im[ii*2:ii*2+2 , jj*2:jj*2+2])
        
        
 Keras pooling layers
Keras implements a pooling operation as a layer that can be added to CNNs between other layers. In this exercise, you will construct a convolutional neural network similar to the one you have constructed before:

Convolution => Convolution => Flatten => Dense

However, you will also add a pooling layer. The architecture will add a single max-pooling layer between the convolutional layer and the dense layer with a pooling of 2x2:

Convolution => Max pooling => Convolution => Flatten => Dense

A Sequential model along with Dense, Conv2D, Flatten, and MaxPool2D objects are available in your workspace.

Instructions
100 XP
Add an input convolutional layer (15 units, kernel size of 2, relu activation).
Add a maximum pooling operation (pooling over windows of size 2x2).
Add another convolution layer (5 units, kernel size of 2, relu activation).
Flatten the output of the second convolution and add a Dense layer for output (3 categories, softmax activation).

# Add a convolutional layer
model.add(Conv2D(15, kernel_size=2, activation='relu', 
                 input_shape=(img_rows, img_cols, 1)))

# Add a pooling operation
model.add(MaxPool2D(2))

# Add another convolutional layer
model.add(Conv2D(5, kernel_size=2, activation='relu'))

# Flatten and feed to output layer
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(3, activation='softmax'))
model.summary()


Train a deep CNN with pooling to classify images
Training a CNN with pooling layers is very similar to training of the deep networks that y have seen before. Once the network is constructed (as you did in the previous exercise), the model needs to be appropriately compiled, and then training data needs to be provided, together with the other arguments that control the fitting procedure.

The following model from the previous exercise is available in your workspace:

Convolution => Max pooling => Convolution => Flatten => Dense

Instructions
100 XP
Compile this model to use the categorical cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer.
Train the model for 3 epochs with batches of size 10.
Use 20% of the data as validation data.
Evaluate the model on test_data with test_labels (also batches of size 10).

# Compile model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', 
              loss='categorical_crossentropy', 
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Fit the model to training data 
model.fit(train_data, train_labels, 
          validation_split=0.2, 
          epochs=3, batch_size=10)

# Evaluate the model on test data
model.evaluate(test_data, test_labels, batch_size=10)


Plot the learning curves
During learning, the model will store the loss function evaluated in each epoch. Looking at the learning curves can tell us quite a bit about the learning process. In this exercise, you will plot the learning and validation loss curves for a model that you will train.

Instructions
100 XP
Fit the model to the training data (train_data).
Use a validation split of 20%, 3 epochs and batch size of 10.
Plot the training loss.
Plot the validation loss.


Using stored weights to predict in a test set
Model weights stored in an hdf5 file can be reused to populate an untrained model. Once the weights are loaded into this model, it behaves just like a model that has been trained to reach these weights. For example, you can use this model to make predictions from an unseen data set (e.g. test_data).

Instructions
100 XP
Load the weights from a file called 'weights.hdf5'.
Predict the classes of the first three images from test_data.

# Load the weights from file
model.load_weights('weights.hdf5')
# Predict from the first three images in the test data
model.predict(test_data[:3]) 

# Add a convolutional layer
model.add(Conv2D(15, kernel_size=2, activation='relu', 
                 input_shape=(img_rows, img_cols, 1)))

# Add a dropout layer
model.add(Dropout(0.2))

# Add another convolutional layer
model.add(Conv2D(5, kernel_size=2, activation='relu'))

# Flatten and feed to output layer
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(3, activation='softmax'))

Add batch normalization to your network
Batch normalization is another form of regularization that rescales the outputs of a layer to make sure that they have mean 0 and standard deviation 1. In this exercise, we will add batch normalization to the convolutional neural network that we have used in previous exercises:

Convolution (15 units, kernel size 2, 'relu' activation)
Batch normalization
Convolution (5 unites, kernel size 2, 'relu' activation)
Flatten
Dense (3 units, 'softmax' activation)
A Sequential model along with Dense, Conv2D, Flatten, and Dropout objects are available in your workspace.

Instructions
100 XP
Add the first convolutional layer. You can use the img_rows and img_cols objects available in your workspace to define the input_shape of this layer.
Add batch normalization applied to the outputs of the first layer.

# Load the weights into the model
model.load_weights('weights.hdf5')

# Get the first convolutional layer from the model
c1 = model.layers[0]

# Get the weights of the first convolutional layer
weights1 = c1.get_weights()

# Pull out the first channel of the first kernel in the first layer
kernel = weights1[0][...,0, 0]
print(kernel)

Shape of the weights
A Keras neural network stores its layers in a list called model.layers. For the convolutional layers, you can get the weights using the .get_weights() method. This returns a list, and the first item in this list is an array representing the weights of the convolutional kernels. If the shape of this array is (2, 2, 1, 5), what does the first number (2) represent?


The kernel size is 2 by 2.

Visualizing kernel responses
One of the ways to interpret the weights of a neural network is to see how the kernels stored in these weights "see" the world. That is, what properties of an image are emphasized by this kernel. In this exercise, we will do that by convolving an image with the kernel and visualizing the result. Given images in the test_data variable, a function called extract_kernel() that extracts a kernel from the provided network, and the function called convolution() that we defined in the first chapter, extract the kernel, load the data from a file and visualize it with matplotlib.

A deep CNN model, a function convolution(), along with the kernel you extracted in an earlier exercise is available in your workspace.

Instructions
100 XP
Use the convolution() function to convolve the extracted kernel with the first channel of the fourth item in the image array.
Visualize the resulting convolution with imshow().

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Convolve with the fourth image in test_data
out = convolution(test_data[3, :, :, 0], kernel)

# Visualize the result
plt.imshow(out)
plt.show()
